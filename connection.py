"""
CHORDS Data Connection-
This scripts provides a unified interface for connecting to CHORDS devices via multiple protocols
(USB, WiFi, BLE) and streaming data to LSL (Lab Streaming Layer) and/or CSV files.

Key Features:
- Multi-protocol support (USB, WiFi, BLE)
- Simultaneous LSL streaming and CSV recording
- Automatic device discovery and connection

Typical Usage:
1. Initialize Connection object
2. Connect to device via preferred protocol
3. Configure LSL stream parameters
4. Start data streaming/CSV recording
5. Process incoming data
6. Clean shutdown on exit

class Connection:
    """
    Main connection manager class for supported devices.
    This class serves as the central hub for all device communication, providing:
    - Unified interface across multiple connection protocols(WiFi/BLE/USB)
    - Data streaming to LSL
    - Data recording to CSV files
    - Connection state management
    - Sample validation and rate monitorin
    The class maintains separate connection handlers for each protocol (USB/WiFi/BLE)
    and manages their lifecycle. It implements thread-safe operations for concurrent
    data handling and provides clean shutdown procedures.
